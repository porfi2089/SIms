=============
Release guide
=============


.. admonition::  This document is only relevant for Matplotlib release managers.

   A guide for developers who are doing a Matplotlib release.


.. note::

   This assumes that a read-only remote for the canonical repository is
   ``remote`` and a read/write remote is ``DANGER``


.. _release-testing:

Testing
=======

We use `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/actions>`__
for continuous integration.  When preparing for a release, the final tagged
commit should be tested locally before it is uploaded::

   pytest -n 8 .


In addition the following test should be run and manually inspected::

   python tools/memleak.py agg 1000 agg.pdf


In addition the following should be run and manually inspected, but
is currently broken::

   pushd examples/tests/
   python backend_driver_sgskip.py
   popd


.. _release_ghstats:

GitHub statistics
=================


We automatically extract GitHub issue, PRs, and authors from GitHub via the
API.  Copy the current :file:`doc/users/github_stats.rst` to
:file:`doc/users/prev_whats_new/github_stats_X.Y.Z.rst`, changing the link
target at the top of the file, and removing the "Previous GitHub Stats" section
at the end.

For example, when updating from v3.2.0 to v3.2.1::

  cp doc/users/github_stats.rst doc/users/prev_whats_new/github_stats_3.2.0.rst
  $EDITOR doc/users/prev_whats_new/github_stats_3.2.0.rst
  # Change contents as noted above.
  git add doc/users/prev_whats_new/github_stats_3.2.0.rst

Then re-generate the updated stats::

  python tools/github_stats.py --since-tag v3.2.0 --milestone=v3.2.1 --project 'matplotlib/matplotlib' --links > doc/users/github_stats.rst

Review and commit changes.  Some issue/PR titles may not be valid reST (the
most common issue is ``*`` which is interpreted as unclosed markup).

.. note::

   Make sure you authenticate against the GitHub API.  If you
   do not you will get blocked by GitHub for going over the API rate
   limits.  You can authenticate in one of two ways:

   * using the ``keyring`` package; ``pip install keyring`` and then when
     running the stats script, you will be prompted for user name and password,
     that will be stored in your system keyring, or,
   * using a personal access token; generate a new token `on this GitHub page
     <https://github.com/settings/tokens>`__ with the ``repo:public_repo``
     scope and place the token in :file:`~/.ghoauth`.


.. _release_chkdocs:

Update and validate the docs
============================

Merge ``*-doc`` branch
----------------------

Merge the most recent 'doc' branch (e.g., ``v3.2.0-doc``) into the branch you
are going to tag on and delete the doc branch on GitHub.

Update supported versions in Security Policy
--------------------------------------------

When making major or minor releases, update the supported versions in the
Security Policy in :file:`SECURITY.md`.  Commonly, this may be one or two
previous minor releases, but is dependent on release managers.

Update release notes
--------------------

What's new
~~~~~~~~~~

*Only needed for major and minor releases. Bugfix releases should not have new
features.*

Merge the contents of all the files in :file:`doc/users/next_whats_new/`
into a single file :file:`doc/users/prev_whats_new/whats_new_X.Y.0.rst`
and delete the individual files.

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

*Primarily needed for major and minor releases. We may sometimes have API
changes in bugfix releases.*

Merge the contents of all the files in :file:`doc/api/next_api_changes/`
into a single file :file:`doc/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_X.Y.Z.rst`
and delete the individual files.

Release notes TOC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update :file:`doc/users/release_notes.rst`:

- For major and minor releases add a new section

  .. code:: rst

     X.Y
     ===
     .. toctree::
         :maxdepth: 1

         prev_whats_new/whats_new_X.Y.0.rst
         ../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_X.Y.0.rst
         prev_whats_new/github_stats_X.Y.0.rst
- For bugfix releases add the GitHub stats and (if present) the API changes to
  the existing X.Y section

  .. code:: rst

     ../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_X.Y.Z.rst
     prev_whats_new/github_stats_X.Y.Z.rst

Update version switcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update ``doc/_static/switcher.json``.  If a minor release, ``X.Y.Z``, create
a new entry ``version: X.Y.(Z-1)``, and change the name of stable
``name: stable/X.Y.Z``.  If a major release, ``X.Y.0``, change the name
of ``name: devel/X.(Y+1)`` and ``name: stable/X.Y.0`` as well as adding
a new version for the previous stable.

Verify that docs build
----------------------

Finally, make sure that the docs build cleanly ::

  make -Cdoc O=-j$(nproc) html latexpdf

After the docs are built, check that all of the links, internal and external,
are still valid.  We use ``linkchecker`` for this, which has not been ported to
Python3 yet.  You will need to create a Python2 environment with
``requests==2.9.0`` and linkchecker ::

  conda create -p /tmp/lnkchk python=2 requests==2.9.0
  source activate /tmp/lnkchk
  pip install linkchecker
  pushd doc/build/html
  linkchecker index.html --check-extern
  popd

Address any issues which may arise.  The internal links are checked on Circle
CI, this should only flag failed external links.


Update supported versions in SECURITY.md
----------------------------------------

For minor version release update the table in :file:`SECURITY.md` to specify
that the 2 most recent minor releases in the current major version series are
supported.

For a major version release update the table in :file:`SECURITY.md` to specify
that the last minor version in the previous major version series is still
supported.  Dropping support for the last version of a major version series
will be handled on an ad-hoc basis.

.. _release_tag:

Create release commit and tag
=============================

To create the tag, first create an empty commit with a very terse set of the release notes
in the commit message ::

  git commit --allow-empty

and then create a signed, annotated tag with the same text in the body
message ::

  git tag -a -s v2.0.0

which will prompt you for your GPG key password and an annotation.  For pre
releases it is important to follow :pep:`440` so that the build artifacts will
sort correctly in PyPI.

To prevent issues with any down-stream builders which download the
tarball from GitHub it is important to move all branches away from the commit
with the tag [#]_::

  git commit --allow-empty

Finally, push the tag to GitHub::

  git push DANGER main v2.0.0

Congratulations, the scariest part is done!

.. [#] The tarball that is provided by GitHub is produced using `git archive`_.
       We use setuptools_scm_ which uses a format string in
       :file:`lib/matplotlib/_version.py` to have ``git`` insert a
       list of references to exported commit (see
       :file:`.gitattributes` for the configuration).  This string is
       then used by ``setuptools_scm`` to produce the correct version,
       based on the git tag, when users install from the tarball.
       However, if there is a branch pointed at the tagged commit,
       then the branch name will also be included in the tarball.
       When the branch eventually moves, anyone how checked the hash
       of the tarball before the branch moved will have an incorrect
       hash.

       To generate the file that GitHub does use ::

          git archive v2.0.0 -o matplotlib-2.0.0.tar.gz --prefix=matplotlib-2.0.0/

.. _git archive: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-archive
.. _setuptools_scm: https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm

If this is a final release, also create a 'doc' branch (this is not
done for pre-releases)::

   git branch v2.0.0-doc
   git push DANGER v2.0.0-doc

and if this is a major or minor release, also create a bug-fix branch (a micro
release will be cut from this branch)::

   git branch v2.0.x

On this branch un-comment the globs from :ref:`release_chkdocs`.  And then ::

   git push DANGER v2.0.x




.. _release_DOI:

Release management / DOI
========================

Via the `GitHub UI
<https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/releases>`__, turn the newly
pushed tag into a release.  If this is a pre-release remember to mark
it as such.

For final releases, also get the DOI from `zenodo
<https://zenodo.org/>`__ (which will automatically produce one once
the tag is pushed).  Add the doi post-fix and version to the dictionary in
:file:`tools/cache_zenodo_svg.py` and run the script.


This will download the new svg to the :file:`_static` directory in the
docs and edit :file:`doc/citing.rst`.  Commit the new svg, the change
to :file:`tools/cache_zenodo_svg.py`, and the changes to
:file:`doc/citing.rst` to the VER-doc branch and push to GitHub. ::

  git checkout v2.0.0-doc
  $EDITOR tools/cache_zenodo_svg.py
  python tools/cache_zenodo_svg.py
  $EDITOR doc/citing.html
  git commit -a
  git push DANGER v2.0.0-doc:v2.0.0-doc

.. _release_bld_bin:

Building binaries
=================

We distribute macOS, Windows, and many Linux wheels as well as a source tarball
via PyPI.  Most builders should trigger automatically once the tag is pushed to
GitHub:

* Windows, macOS and manylinux wheels are built on GitHub Actions.  Builds are
  triggered by the GitHub Action defined in
  :file:`.github/workflows/cibuildwheel.yml`, and wheels will be available as
  artifacts of the build.
* Alternative Windows wheels are built by Christoph Gohlke automatically and
  will be `available at his site
  <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib>`__ once built.
* The auto-tick bot should open a pull request into the `conda-forge feedstock
  <https://github.com/conda-forge/matplotlib-feedstock>`__.  Review and merge
  (if you have the power to).

.. warning::

   Because this is automated, it is extremely important to bump all branches
   away from the tag as discussed in :ref:`release_tag`.

If this is a final release the following downstream packagers should be contacted:

- Debian
- Fedora
- Arch
- Gentoo
- Macports
- Homebrew
- Continuum
- Enthought

This can be done ahead of collecting all of the binaries and uploading to pypi.


.. _release_upload_bin:

Make distribution and upload to PyPI
====================================

Once you have collected all of the wheels (expect this to take about a
day), generate the tarball ::

  git checkout v2.0.0
  git clean -xfd
  python setup.py sdist

and copy all of the wheels into :file:`dist` directory.  First, check
that the dist files are OK ::

  twine check dist/*

and then use ``twine`` to upload all of the files to pypi ::

   twine upload -s dist/matplotlib*tar.gz
   twine upload dist/*whl

Congratulations, you have now done the second scariest part!


.. _release_docs:

Build and deploy documentation
==============================

To build the documentation you must have the tagged version installed, but
build the docs from the ``ver-doc`` branch.  An easy way to arrange this is::

  pip install matplotlib
  pip install -r requirements/doc/doc-requirements.txt
  git checkout v2.0.0-doc
  git clean -xfd
  make -Cdoc O="-t release -j$(nproc)" html latexpdf LATEXMKOPTS="-silent -f"

which will build both the html and pdf version of the documentation.


The built documentation exists in the `matplotlib.github.com
<https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.github.com/>`__ repository.
Pushing changes to main automatically updates the website.

The documentation is organized by version.  At the root of the tree is always
the documentation for the latest stable release.  Under that, there are
directories containing the documentation for older versions.  The documentation
for current main is built on Circle CI and pushed to the `devdocs
<https://github.com/matplotlib/devdocs/>`__ repository.  These are available at
`matplotlib.org/devdocs <https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/>`__.

Assuming you have this repository checked out in the same directory as
matplotlib ::

  cd ../matplotlib.github.com
  mkdir 2.0.0
  rsync -a ../matplotlib/doc/build/html/* 2.0.0
  cp ../matplotlib/doc/build/latex/Matplotlib.pdf 2.0.0

which will copy the built docs over.  If this is a final release, link the
``stable`` subdirectory to the newest version::

  rsync -a 2.0.0/* ./
  rm stable
  ln -s 2.0.0/ stable

You will need to manually edit :file:`versions.html` to show the last
3 tagged versions.  You will also need to edit :file:`sitemap.xml` to include
the newly released version.  Now commit and push everything to GitHub ::

  git add *
  git commit -a -m 'Updating docs for v2.0.0'
  git push DANGER main

Congratulations you have now done the third scariest part!

If you have access, clear the Cloudflare caches.

It typically takes about 5-10 minutes for GitHub to process the push
and update the live web page (remember to clear your browser cache).


Announcing
==========

The final step is to announce the release to the world.  A short
version of the release notes along with acknowledgments should be sent to

- matplotlib-users@python.org
- matplotlib-devel@python.org
- matplotlib-announce@python.org

For final releases announcements should also be sent to the
numpy/scipy/scikit-image mailing lists.

In addition, announcements should be made on social networks (twitter
via the ``@matplotlib`` account, any other via personal accounts).
`NumFOCUS <https://numfocus.org/>`__ should be contacted for
inclusion in their newsletter.


Conda packages
==============

The Matplotlib project itself does not release conda packages. In particular,
the Matplotlib release manager is not responsible for conda packaging.

For information on the packaging of Matplotlib for conda-forge see
https://github.com/conda-forge/matplotlib-feedstock.
