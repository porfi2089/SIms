Contributing
############

Thank you for your interest in helping to improve Matplotlib! There are various
ways to contribute to Matplotlib. All of them are super valuable but don't necessarily
require writing code at all. For example:

- contributing to the documentation
- opening new issues for bugs
- requesting new features
- asking for clarification on things you find unclear
- fixing bugs

If you have any questions on the
process or how to fix something feel free to ask on `gitter
<https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib>`_ for short questions and on
`discourse <https://discourse.matplotlib.org>`_ for longer questions.
