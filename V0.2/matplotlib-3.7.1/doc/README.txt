Matplotlib documentation
========================

Building the documentation
--------------------------

See :file:`doc/devel/documenting_mpl.rst` for instructions to build the docs.

Organization
------------

This is the top level build directory for the Matplotlib
documentation.  All of the documentation is written using sphinx, a
python documentation system built on top of ReST.  This directory contains

* users - the user documentation, e.g., installation, plotting tutorials,
configuration tips, faq, explanations, etc.

* devel - documentation for Matplotlib developers

* api - placeholders to automatically generate the api documentation

* tutorials, plot_types, and gallery - automatically
generated by sphinx-gallery from ``../tutorials``, ``../plot_types``, and
``../examples`` respectively (these are only present if docs have been
built locally).

* thirdpartypackages - redirect to <https://matplotlib.org/mpl-third-party/>

* mpl_toolkits - documentation of individual toolkits that ship with
  Matplotlib

* index.rst - the top level include document for Matplotlib docs

* conf.py - the sphinx configuration

* Makefile and make.bat - entry points for building the docs

* _static - used by the sphinx build system

* _templates - used by the sphinx build system

* sphinxext - Sphinx extensions for the Matplotlib docs
